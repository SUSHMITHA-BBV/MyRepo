## A doctor patient handling, managing system is proposed, that helps doctors to keep a medical progress on their patients and patients to upload their vitals and view the comments of the doctor. The system allows doctors to manage the patient’s vitals on a weekly or monthly basis. Patients are allowed to follow the doctors of their choice and the doctors are reserved in their name. Each time a patient consults a doctor, the medical entries are stored in the database. Next time a patient logs in the entire medical history is available as and when needed. At the same time a doctor may view patient’s medical history even before the patient visits him and can comment as well as diagnose the patient. This allows for an automated patient doctor handling system through an online interface.
